The owners and staff make this a very special place to stay. The food is amazing & very reasonable as are the drinks [& I had a cooking lesson with the fabulous chef]. The rooms [all suites] are spacious and confortable, everywhere spotlessly clean.  The pool and garden areas are an oasis of tranquility, away from the noise and bustle of the main road. Yes, conpared to some of the accomodation in Goa, it is relatively expensive. However, you get what you pay for. In our opinion worth every single penny - a touch of luxury. We had room service a couple of times and dinner up on the rooftop [watched sunset over beach] - amazing quality and as cheap if not cheaper than resturants and shacks nearby.

Plenty of sun loungers and extra towels if needed. 
We had a double room in the main building which was spacious and well fitted. Good powerful showers and room cleaning by Sylvester was to a high standard.
The hotel location is a 10 minute walk down to the beach. We also discovered some quieter lanes down to the beach. Loads of places to eat or just drink in this well behaved town!
Quite a few British people from Tui package tours in the hotel and congregating around the bar area and a few Indian families from North India. Everyone seems to rub along well.

The chef was AMAZING - he also organised a birthday cake for my daughter for a surprise and the staff all sang to her at breakfast - was a great touch.

 Pool areas x 3 - all lovely but was disappointed that we had to move twice due to large groups of rowdy men playing with balls in the pool and splashing us - when pointed out to the reception they just told us to go to another of the pools - i would think for a 5 star hotel they would make rules about large groups disturbing the people trying to relax by the pool especially as we couldnt even get into two of the pools on one day because of the ball being thrown.

With all that, there was plenty of floor space available to walk about. The stay was uber-comfortable. The service staff were AMAZING! EVERY SINGLE PERSON served with a smile on their face and were very courteous - special call out to the staff in the reception area, restaurant and in-room dining staff and housekeeping staff. The breakfast buffet had a good spread of vegetarian dishes which were delicious. The owner made visits during the breakfast time and interacted with the guests and assured them of a comfortable stay - this personal touch was much appreciated. We were there for our honeymoon and they were gracious enough to send over a cake for us. The Lunch and Dinner menus were also very good. All of the items we ordered (tandoori rotis, panneer dishes, fried rice, noodles, fries, ginger tea, dal khichadi etc) over the span of 3-4 days were really good. The in-room dining experience was great - they got all orders right and the food came promptly. The in-house restaurant was also a good spot to unwind and have a peaceful meal during lunch and dinner times. The whole facility was spotlessly clean. The reception area with its high glass windows/doors is a sight to see during the daytime. The hotel itself is 5 minutes away from Candolim beach and so easy to get to for sunrise and sunset. There are shops and restaurants on the same road which gives us tourists plenty of choices. The hotel staff also help arrange cab services and provide recommendations for places to visit. The only area we did not get to use was the pool area, but other tourists seemed to have had a good time. Overall, a great experience.",Couple,2023-03-02,"Amazing, Relaxing, Safe, Satisfying!"

And when I booked this hotel, i was always doubtful how will it turn out. But, this wonderful thoughfully designed property beat all our doubts and made it our favourite hotel in Goa. This was my 3rd visit to Goa in last 6 years and I have stayed in several good hotels in Varca, panjim, baga before. But candolim totally surprised us and seashells was cherry on the top. They have magnificent staff. Naming a few will not do justice to all those who couldn't introduce themselves but always greeted us with a smile and greeting. Since, this was my first visit to far away place with my 1.5 yr old daughter, i never felt out of home. The staff were extremely friendly and caring and offered help out of way. We stayed for 2 days in junior suite which was road facing. The suites are approximately double the size of rooms one usually gets in hotels. And there is ample amount of space for a kid to play around. They have 24 hr dining service and they prepared meals on special request even if it was not on their menu. The exterior of the hotel is big and surrounded by big trees around. So one can even lie around pools without worrying about sun. They have 3 big pools,nice walk away and serene environment. They greeted my daughter everytime with chocolates and baked a super yum chocolate cake. Breakfast had many varieties. Whole of the hotel was spotless clean. Room had access to instant hot water 24 hours a day. Wifi was great. Overall we enjoyed a lot and more importantly my daughter just loved the placed and felt extremely comfortable.

My vacation could not have been better in any sense - the hospitality, comfort and personal care shown by the hotel staff (front desk, restaurant, cleaning staff, Managers, Director and owner) was top notch. We stayed for 4 nights in the junior suite. Special thanks to - Mr. Schubert for giving us good suggestions for beach visits, Mr. Candolkar for the lovely conversations we had each morning during our breakfast and the owner for the delicious chocolate cake for our son. The property is the best place for families, especially those travelling with young kids. The staff and management make you feel extremely comfortable and take care of even the minutest of things. We hope to go back soon and experience the warmth of their hospitality again. 

The breakfast spread was amazing and the chef makes mouth watering dosa, uthappam and omelets. The chocolate and fruit pancake was icing on the cake. The staff went extra mile and even prepared specialized meals for our son.

The location is stunning and it is a 5 min walk to the Candolim beach. The property is bang on the main road (Fort Aguada) and despite being in a busy place, it is serene once you step in the property. There is ample greenery and just sitting in the balcony each evening/night can be a soothing experience.

Right from booking to check-in and check-out, everything was very smooth. Since we were a big group, I had a lot of questions while booking. Raina Srivastava from Reservations was very helpful and always available to answer my queries. She made sure that all my guests were accommodated as per my instructions (my friends & family checked in early and I & my wife checked in a day later). We had booked 3 bedroom villas and also a king bed suite. The hotel is very neat and clean. The villas/rooms are very neat/ clean, spacious with all amenities (microwave, fridge, iron box & iron stand, Digital Safe etc). There are 3 swimming pools! What is noteworthy about this place is that each & every staff member (from reservation, to front desk, to waiters, house keeping etc) is very polite and customer friendly. The food from the inhouse restaurant also was very yummy!
All in all an amazing stay in a hotel that offers great hospitality with very courteous and polite staff!!
