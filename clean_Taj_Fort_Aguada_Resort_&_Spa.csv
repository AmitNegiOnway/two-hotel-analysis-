Jill,United States,Aguada Cottage Sea View - King Bed,2024-03-01,10,7,"The sea view was unbelievably beautiful, as was the garden setting. We also liked the privacy of the cottage and its decor. It was fun to explore both Taj properties and eat in various restaurants. Our favorite was the Banyan Tree, and we were pleasantly surprised with the variety at Caravela in the early evening. We are glad we chose the Fort Aguada Taj because it felt more intimate and because we didn't like the alcohol bar mentality at the Holiday Village pool. Kudos to Kailash in housekeeping and Aarushi at the breakfast buffet. We decided halfway through our stay that we didn't want to take any more tours.

By the end, we just didn't want to leave, even though we had been there 8 days. 

Some of the absolute gems of the staff I'd like to highlight -

Avila from the Caravela restaurant. She pampered our kids no end, was one of the sweetest people we've ever met. 
Abigail, Jesyl and Abhirami from the reception- they were so helpful always. Also fussing over us.
Sanjeev and Sahoo from the pool across both the properties. Very caring and careful about the kids in the pool.

The property is very well maintained and staff is very courteous. As my daughter is allergic to certain food items so met the chefs at Kokum restaurant well in advance and informed them about the food allergies. I really appreciate the efforts put in by Chef Roshan, Chef Priyaranjan and Chef Nishant to make us and my daughter feel comfortable. They took very good care of our daughter and made her stay in Goa comfortable. We enjoyed a lot due to them. Other staff at the Kokum restaurant like Vincent was always checking on us and what we need when we were there. Vincent is working in this facility for 40 years and now retiring in March'24, Best wishes to him. The staff at the pool, Gym and other facilities was also very courteous.

I checked-in with my parents to celebrate my dad's 80th birthday at Taj Fort Aguada Goa. Perfect location to relax and unwind. Beautiful property. But what makes this property special is the people! 

Unfortunately, on our second night, my Mom who is 75 years old, fell terribly sick. Within minutes of informing Guest Services,  I had the local doctor on the phone and a team of individuals from Guest Services at the cottage door. They immediately helped place my mom on a stretcher and transported her to the nearest hospital in the hotel car. I had two team members with me at all times who took care of all our needs. Including the little things such as organizing sandwiches for me and my dad in the middle of the night at the hospital. Moreover, the team gave us the emotional strength to deal with the situation. My mom was discharged from the hospital after two days, and she received a very warm welcome back at the hotel (hand made card and gifts) 

Special mention to Abigail and Edward from Guest Services, without whom not sure how i would have handled the medical emergency. Thanks to the executive chef Dibyendu Roy  my Mom received special meals on her return. And none of this would have been possible if it wasn't for the exceptional leadership at the property starting with Nisha Sharma  the Front Office Manager, Praydhumna Singh the Hotel Manager and Anmol Ahluwalia the Cluster General Manager.

Maryna,India,Aguada Cottage Garden View - King Bed,2022-04-01,9,4,"Hassle free check in and check out. Transportation to and from the hotel. We stayed at the cottage with garden view, but actually we had the best view of the property- it is above the reception, and we could see all of the beach and the sea. Going to and from the cottage there is free car that you don't need to book- the cars/shuttles are always there at the reception- and they take you to the sister property as well (Taj Village resort).
The hospitality of the staff was outstanding, food quality and variety absolutely fantastic. The breakfast at the Konkum restaurant was catered to all the dietary needs, and there is even lactose-free milk. There is so much food: plenty for veg and non-veg eaters, egg station and a waffle/pancake station as well, danish pastries very fresh every day, cold cuts and cheese. Good variety of drinks. The servers were very polite and swift.
Swimming pool is very big, and the attendant, Mr. Sanjeev, was most helpful and caring, always offering chilled water, looking after our things while we go out to the beach. 
Room service menu is good, and the service is great, food is very tasty. 
The cottage is very spacious. We had a big balcony and an access to the garden with lounge chairs. Lots of sun and shade to comfortably spend a hot afternoon outside. 
Anything you need from the housekeeping is just a call away.",Family,2022-04-20,Very enjoyable vacation,78.9629,20.5937

Aditya,India,Aguada Cottage Garden View - King Bed,2021-09-01,9,2,"The resort is built on the lower side of the Fort Aguada. The breakfast and the service in general was very good. The property is huge and you can use the in-house car pick up to come to the lobby, or go to the nearby Taj Village. One of the best features was that they have a sister property ""Taj Holiday Village"" that is ~400 metres away, and they have cabs to take you there. You can enjoy the facilities of both the resorts. Chilling in the swimming pool (and getting drinks served there) was so much fun.

Taj Aguada is built on a hilly area of sorts, and you have a great view from the top most level. There are peacocks roaming around in the property, which is of course, great. You can go to the Fort area (just 50 metres outside the walls) and enjoy the view of the sea, it feels magical at night in moonlight!

The best thing about Taj Aguada is the service across the board - be it during meals, or when you are enjoying in the pool or in the evening when there are live shows. Totally worth paying that price to get here, and allow the Taj folks to pamper you. Loved the experience.",Couple,2021-10-12,Amazing get-away place; allow yourself to get pampered at Taj!,78.9629,20.5937

The villa was lovely and very comfortable with private garden space, lovely seating, big comfortable beds, spacious rooms and bathroom with all amenities. It is quite far up on the hill and away from the sea, but the car shuttles are available on call and they come immediately. I was pleasantly surprised to see the property is planted with many native tree species apart from ornamentals. It is well-wooded. Saw many interesting birds including the Grey hornbill, Vigor's sunbird, lorikeets (vernal hanging parrots) and many others during our stay. Lots of butterflies too.
The location is great as it is with the Fort Aguada and cliffside path and the sea. Came to know towards the end of our stay that breakfast etc is also served at the Hermitage Lounge which is half way down the road track from the villas to the main lobby.

The swimming pool was a beauty . One can spend hours on the porches . Both the restaurants were luxurious , we liked the Morisco better , perhaps because we had a bias towards sea food . 
The breakfast spreads were splendid . 
The service was exemplary . We had been to two 5 star hotels of some other groups in last 3 months , but the friendliness , efficiency & promptness of the Taj staff beats them by miles .

Abhinav,India,Aguada Cottage Sea View - Twin Bed,2022-06-01,1,3,"This resort is a fraud and I WILL NOT RECOMMEND “families with kids” to stay at this place.

RUDE STAFF • UNPROFESSIONALISM • FALSE PROMISES ABOUT ROOM SIZES and FOOD

1. We booked a villa “Cottage Sea View / Twin Bed” which Taj says can stay 2 adults and 2 kids.  Taj is simply a fraud here.  They falsely advertise their rooms and it’s capacities and sizes.  No way, seriously no way that room will accommodate 2 adults and 2 kids.  Come on, stop making fools out of your customers.

Note that, their site claims you can accommodate a family of 4 without additional beds.

Additional bed is just an offering.  It’s not a necessity per their website.  But once you reach there, you will realise, it’s their bluff.

2. THEY WILL TRY TO CHARGE U AS U REACH THE RECEPTION.

“DO NOT PAY THEM” IN FULL WITHOUT LOOKING AT YOUR ROOMS.

THIS IS THEIR TRICK, or rather, this is how they save themselves, because they know, customer is not going to get what they expected or saw online.

3. Reservation (receipt) says food included with booking.  NO WHERE IT SAYS BUFFET INCLUDED.

I SIMPLY EXPECT IN ROOM FOOD.  YOUR SITE,  RESERVATION RECEIPT, nowhere have you mentioned a buffet.

But when we reached at 7:30pm and asked for in-room dining, they simply DENIED SERVING THE FOOD.

No way my under-7yr old kids will walk down to your buffet hall.  Note that, you will have to walk 200 stairs down and then up, after travelling for the whole day.

Is this place really for kids?   Are your kids taking a 1/2 km walk to have their food?

What a horrible experience with kids.   By the end of our vacation, my kids just had one thing to say “Daddy, we can’t walk down again for food”",Family,2022-06-21,"(1) Basic things like drinking water bottles, shampoo etc were not ensured by default - we needed to always call to get",78.9629,20.5937
